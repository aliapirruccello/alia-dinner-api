# alia-dinner-api
This is API code for dinner recipes

Here is a link to an app that uses the API code to be able to make dinner requests: [https://takemetoflavortown.netlify.app/)]

I hosted this API on Heroku and made a simple UI

# Optimizations

When I improve this project, I want to be able to have the images pull up for each dinner.

# Lessons Learned

Images need to be linked to an image online instead of image in Google doc
